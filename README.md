# Simon-Game 
A fun short-term memory game where you have to remember the sequence of the colours, See -->https://mevinmoncy.github.io/Simon-Game/

How to Play:
1. Press the A button to begin the game.
2. Memorize the selected colour pattern and then click on the repeated color pattern.

Why I made this game?
This game reinforced all the high quilites of a website - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was able to utilize functions, arrays, etc to create this highly interactive game
